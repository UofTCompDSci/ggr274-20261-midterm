    "\n",
    "- The test is divided into 7 questions with a total of 42 marks. The total number of marks for the test is 42. Complete all questions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The answers to the questions will be submitted on MarkUs using a similar workflow to the lab and homework assignments, except there are no automated tests available to you on MarkUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have provided some code to help you check your programming work, but you are also welcome to add additional print statements to help you test your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In many questions we have given you values for some variables.  You code should continue to work even if we changed the values of these variables. In other words, we are grading your ability to use python to compute the answer, not just the answer itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Answers where you are asked to write Python code will be autograded and hand checked by the teaching team; written answers will be graded manually by the teaching team.\n",

    "Conclusion (for each part) | No answer | The question is answered but no explanation is given or the explanation is irrelvant to the data analysis presented | The question is answered based on the data analysis presented, but the analysis does not fully support the explanation | The question is answered and the explanation is fully supported by the data analysis\n",

    "- You are allowed to use any materials on Jupyter Hub and from the course website, as well as your own notes.\n",

    "- You may not use any electronic aids other than what is available to you on the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a student, you alone are responsible for ensuring the integrity of your work and for understanding what [constitutes an academic offense](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/academic-advising-and-support/student-academic-integrity/academic-misconduct).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Allowed\n",
    "\n",
    "- The test will be available at 09:10 AM on Tuesday, February 10, and must be submitted on MarkUs by the end of the test period at 11:00 am (see Submission Instructions).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Late tests will receive a grade of zero unless you have an approved accommodation from your instructor. When in doubt, upload your submission anyway, even if there is a warning message. If you are writing with ATS, follow the time instructions given by ATS even if MarkUs differs and gives you a warning message.\n"
